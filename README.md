# Project Euler

I did this projects to improve my coding that involved recursion

## Multiples of Three and Five

This adds all multiples of three and five that are less than n and adds them all up

## Even Fibonacci

The even fibonacci function finds all fibonaccis under n and then selects all the even fibonacci numbers and then adds the even fibonacci numbers up.
