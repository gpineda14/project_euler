# Project Euler

I did this projects to improve my coding that involved recursion

## Multiples of Three and Five

This adds all multiples of three and five that are less than n and adds them all up

## Even Fibonacci

The even fibonacci function finds all fibonaccis under n and then selects all the even fibonacci numbers and then adds the even fibonacci numbers up.

## Largest Prime

The function largest_prime finds the largest prime factor of a number n.

## Largest Palindrome

The function finds the largest palindrome of a product of two three digit numbers

## Smallest Multiple

The function finds the smallest number that is divisible by numbers 1-20. I completed the function but it is not optimized so it takes a while to get the answer.
